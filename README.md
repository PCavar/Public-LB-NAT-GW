## Create a public load balancer to load balance VMs & NAT Gateway using Terraform

### Get started with Azure Load Balancer by using Terraform to create a public load balancer for a backend pool with two virtual machines. Additional resources include Azure Bastion, NAT Gateway, a virtual network, and the required subnets.

#### Link below leads to mslearn and shows an example of what kind of use case this could simulate. This is made entirely of Terraform.
#### These modules can be tweaked to fit your needs. Have fun!
